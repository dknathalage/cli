if doesn't exists, this will create a folder named terraform

reads terraform.yaml in root folder that looks a bit like below

```yaml
components:
  - comp1
  - comp2
environments:
  - dev
  - preprod
```

will create (put #autogenerated comment at the top of the file)

`terraform/comp1/tfvars/dev.tfvars`
`terraform/comp1/tfvars/preprod.tfvars`
`terraform/comp1/main.tf`
`terraform/comp1/variables.tf`
`terraform/comp1/provider.tf`
`terraform/comp1/backend.tf`

variables.tf should have

- project name
- component name
- environment name

should also create a Taskfile.yaml at `./terraform/comp1/Taskfile.yaml`
each tastfile should have following jobs that does as expected

`tf:comp1:init`
`tf:comp1:plan`
`tf:comp1:apply`
`tf:comp1:destroy`
